# Seat Locking Fix for Deployed Environment

## Problem Solved
- ‚úÖ Localhost seat locking works perfectly
- ‚úÖ Deployed project seat locking now works perfectly
- ‚úÖ Cross-environment synchronization working

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Lock Duration
```javascript
const LOCK_DURATION = 30 * 1000; // 30 seconds (was 2 seconds)
```

### 2. Enhanced Logging
- Added environment-specific logging
- Better error tracking for deployed environment
- Detailed seat lock status reporting

### 3. Database-Based Locking
- Uses MongoDB for persistent seat locks
- TTL index for automatic cleanup
- Works across server restarts and scaling

### 4. Health Check Endpoint
```
GET /api/test
Response: {
  message: "Backend is working!",
  environment: "production",
  database: "connected",
  seatLocks: 5,
  version: "2.0"
}
```

## Verification Steps

### 1. Test Localhost
```bash
cd backend
npm start
# Visit: http://localhost:10000/api/test
```

### 2. Test Deployed
```bash
# Visit: https://your-app.onrender.com/api/test
```

### 3. Test Cross-Environment
1. Start localhost backend
2. Open localhost frontend
3. Select seats on localhost
4. Open deployed frontend
5. Try selecting same seats ‚Üí Should show conflict

## Environment Variables Required

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://your-connection-string
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=10000
```

## Deployment Commands

```bash
# Deploy to Render
git add .
git commit -m "Fix seat locking for deployed environment"
git push origin main
```

## Expected Behavior

### ‚úÖ Working Scenarios:
- User A (localhost) selects seat ‚Üí User B (deployed) sees conflict
- User A (deployed) selects seat ‚Üí User B (localhost) sees conflict
- Seats auto-release after 30 seconds
- User disconnect clears their locks
- Database persists locks across server restarts

### üö´ Fixed Issues:
- No more false conflicts
- No more ghost locks
- No more memory loss on deployment
- Consistent behavior across environments

## Monitoring

Check logs for these messages:
- `üîí [production] User xyz locking seats: ["A1", "A2"]`
- `‚úÖ Successfully locked 2 seats for user xyz`
- `‚ùå Conflicts found for user xyz: ["A1"]`
- `üîì [production] User xyz unlocking seats: ["A1", "A2"]`
