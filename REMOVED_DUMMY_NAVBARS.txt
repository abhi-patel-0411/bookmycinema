=====================================

🗑️ DELETED FILES:
-----------------
✅ frontend/src/components/common/MobileNavbar.js (REMOVED)
✅ frontend/src/components/common/Navbar.js (REMOVED - was completely commented out)
✅ frontend/src/components/admin/AdminNavbar.js (REMOVED - was completely commented out)

🔧 UPDATED FILES:
-----------------
✅ frontend/src/App.js
   - Removed MobileNavbar import

   - Now only uses CustomNavbar which has built-in mobile navigation

📱 CURRENT NAVBAR STRUCTURE:
----------------------------
✅ CustomNavbar.js - ACTIVE (handles both desktop and mobile navigation)
   - Desktop: Top navigation bar
   - Mobile: Bottom navigation bar (built-in)
   - Includes user authentication, admin links, audio toggle

✅ AdminLayout.js - ACTIVE (admin panel navigation)
   - Desktop: Sidebar navigation
   - Mobile: Bottom navigation bar
   - Uses admin-navbar.css for UserButton styling

🎯 RESULT:
----------
✅ No more duplicate/dummy navbars
✅ Mobile layout fixes CSS still preserved and working
✅ Single navbar component for user pages (CustomNavbar)
✅ Single layout component for admin pages (AdminLayout)
✅ Cleaner codebase with no redundant navigation components

📱 MOBILE NAVIGATION:
--------------------
✅ User pages: Bottom navigation in CustomNavbar
✅ Admin pages: Bottom navigation in AdminLayout
✅ Both use mobile-layout-fixes.css for proper spacing and styling

⚠️ KEPT FILES (STILL NEEDED):
-----------------------------
✅ frontend/src/styles/admin-navbar.css (KEPT - used by AdminLayout.js for UserButton styling)
✅ frontend/src/styles/mobile-layout-fixes.css (KEPT - required for mobile navigation spacing)

🚀 BENEFITS:
------------
✅ Reduced file count by 3 files
