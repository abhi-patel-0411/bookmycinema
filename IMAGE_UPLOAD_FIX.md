# Image Upload and Display Fix

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Inconsistent URL Construction**: Different components were using different methods to construct image URLs
2. **Poster Field Required**: Movie model required poster field, preventing movies without images
3. **Missing Error Handling**: No proper fallback for broken image URLs

## Changes Made:

### Backend Changes:
1. **Movie Model** (`backend/models/Movie.js`):
   - Made `poster` field optional (required: false)

2. **Movie Controller** (`backend/controllers/movieController.js`):
   - Added detailed logging for file uploads
   - Enhanced error tracking

### Frontend Changes:
1. **Image Utils** (`frontend/src/utils/imageUtils.js`):
   - Simplified `getMoviePosterUrl` function to accept poster path directly
   - Consistent URL construction logic

2. **Movie Card** (`frontend/src/components/common/MovieCard.js`):
   - Using utility function for image URLs
   - Better error handling with fallback images

3. **Admin Components**:
   - **AdminMoviesTable.js**: Using utility function consistently
   - **AdminMovies.js**: Using utility function in all image displays

## How Image Upload Now Works:

1. **File Upload**: 
   - Files are uploaded to `backend/uploads/` directory
   - Filename format: `timestamp-randomnumber.extension`
   - Path stored in database as `/uploads/filename`

2. **URL Construction**:
   - Full URLs (http/https) are used as-is
   - Relative paths are prefixed with API base URL
   - Missing images show placeholder with movie title initial

3. **Display Logic**:
   - All components use `getMoviePosterUrl(posterPath, movieTitle)`
   - Consistent fallback to placeholder images
   - Proper error handling for broken URLs

## Testing:

1. Upload a movie with image file - should work
2. Upload a movie with image URL - should work  
3. Upload a movie without image - should show placeholder
4. Edit existing movie and change image - should work
5. View movie on user side - should display correctly

## File Locations:
- Uploaded files: `backend/uploads/`
- Static file serving: `http://localhost:5000/uploads/filename`
- Frontend API base: `http://localhost:5000` (configurable via env)
